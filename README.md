# BdayTexter
Schedule to send a birthday text.

# Website
I wanted to make a website that would allow the user to fill out a form and send a birthday message to someone on their birthday. 
The website was created on EditorX and used Twilio's features to integrate the ability to send text messages. 
A prototype was modeled out before starting using Figma and a color palette was chosen using Coolers.

# Reflection
I didn't have much experience with usign EditorX or Figma before and wanted to try making a prototype and a website with them.
