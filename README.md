# BdayTexter
Schedule to send a birthday text.

# Website
The website was created on EditorX and used Twilio's features to integrate the ability to send text messages. 
A prototype was modeled out before starting using Figma and a color palette was chosen using Coolers.

## Inspiration
I wanted to try creating a form in which the user can submit information and then use that information.
## What it does
By filling out the form, the user can schedule to send a birthday text to someone else. 
## How I built it
I used Wix's EditorX and Twilio's sms features to build a website. 
## Challenges I ran into
Working with Twilio and EditorX was a new experience for me and I wasn't able to find a way to have the birthday message include the user's name or the recipient's name. I also wasn't able to schedule the message to send at a specific time instead of just immediately. 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The color scheme and design of the website is nicer than I thought it would turn out to be and I was able to get the form to send a message.
## What I learned
I learned more about the design process and gained more experience working with EditorX and Twilio. 
## What's next for bday texter
Next, I would like to find a way to fix the problems I ran into. Also, adding the ability to for the user to send a personalized message to the recipient of their choice would be an interesting feature.
